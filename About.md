# PerfectionV2
Second incarnation of project (added forms, cleaned model code)


This is a simple program built in C#. The idea for this project was to "gamify" goal tracking. I had a few goals going into this when building it:

1. Learn about forms in c#, as I had not used them before
2. Create a good foundational goal architecure (roll up tasks into short term goals into long terms goals)
3. Gamify it with experience points and a (very simple) levelling system.

I achieved these goals with the project, but learn't a number of key things from the project. The most important of which is the importance of MVC (Model-View-Controller), and how ignoring that and produce a program that can be more unwieldy and consequently less scaleable.

The next version of this would involve re-creating it from the ground up on mobile, adding some basic graphical elements and implementing MVC architecure.
